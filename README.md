## Features

Yeek is an offline-first API client designed to stay out of your way while giving you everything you need when you need it.
It’s fast, lightweight, and private. No telemetry, no VC funding, and no cloud lock-in.

### Work with any API

- Import collections from Postman, Insomnia, OpenAPI, Swagger, or Curl.
- Send requests via REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSocket, or Server-Sent Events.
- Filter and inspect responses with JSONPath or XPath.

### Stay secure

- Use OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic Auth, or custom plugins for authentication.
- Secure sensitive values with encrypted secrets. 
- Store secrets in your OS keychain.

### Organize & collaborate

- Group requests into workspaces and nested folders.
- Use environment variables to switch between dev, staging, and prod.
- Mirror workspaces to your filesystem for versioning in Git or syncing with Dropbox.

### Extend & customize

- Insert dynamic values like UUIDs or timestamps with template tags.
- Pick from built-in themes or build your own.
- Create plugins to extend authentication, template tags, or the UI.
